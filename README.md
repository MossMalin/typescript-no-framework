# Problems

## import.meta

Some problems with the .env file but I solved it.

## New without url:s

I decided to do accordion of these instead and had to be creative to be able to add EventListener this kind of stories. Search for houses look for the "Show HN: A Vaadin 24, Spring algebra calculator with dynamic variable buttons".
