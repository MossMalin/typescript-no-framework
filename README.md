## News items without URLs

Some articles don’t include a URL; instead, they provide only a story_text. For these, I decided to display the content in an accordion component. I also had to get a bit creative when adding EventListener support for this type of story.

To see an example, search for "houses" and find the story titled “Show HN: A Vaadin 24, Spring algebra calculator with dynamic variable buttons.”
